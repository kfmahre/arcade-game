Features
--------

- This game is a frogger clone developed by Kyle Mahre for his Udacity nanodegree program.

- The object of the game is to win by moving the player from the bottom of the game board at it's starting position, to the top of the game board, at the water.

- Players move by using the keyboard's arrow keys.

- You must avoid the bugs moving accross the screen, or you will be placed back at the starting position.

- Rocks are an obstacle

- Gems will spawn one at a time and will vanish when the player lands on their tile. As of the writing of this documentation, collecting gems gets the player nowhere. All that is required for victory is to cross the stone tiles without being struck by a bug.

Installation
------------

- Once all the project's files have been downloaded from the repository, all one has to do to play the game is to open the project's index.html file. It is also available to play in your browser without downloading anything here: http://kfmahre.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/

- As of the writing of this readme, the only broswer known to play the game is chrome; however, I am confident that it should function on all browsers, and anyone who wants to try it on a different browser is encouraged to do so.
